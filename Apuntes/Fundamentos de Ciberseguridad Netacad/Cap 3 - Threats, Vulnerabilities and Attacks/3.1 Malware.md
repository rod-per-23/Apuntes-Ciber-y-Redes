# What is a malware?

Malware (short for malicious software) is a piece of software deliberately designed to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, to cause disruption, without the user permission and/or knowledge.

Malware is an umbrella term that describes all types of hostile and intrusive software, like viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware, adware, bloatware, and others. They can be easily identifiable or very stealthy and hard to detect.

## Viruses

This type of malware is often an executable code attached to another file. They often requiere user initiation, like opening the file itself. 
Viruses can spread through the internet, email attachments, removable media like USBs, etcetera. 
To avoid detection, viruses will change (or mutate), and infect other parts of the computer system.
Viruses can range from harmless or incredibly destructive.

## Worms

Worms do not requiere user initiation, and often replicate themselves independently by exploiting vulnerabilities in the network.

## Trojan horse

Trojans hide themselves under the guise of a desired operation, like a video game. The trojan then takes advantage of the privileges it got when the user executes it. They also can bind to non-executable files, like images, audio, text, and others.

## Logic bomb

Logic bombs are a type of malware that wait until certain conditions are met before activating the malicious code. During the previous time, the logic bomb remains inactive.

## Ransomware

Ransomware takes for ransom the computer system itself, with the data locked away by encrypting everything until the victim makes a payment to receive a key to remove the restriction. The criminals use untraceable payment systems like those from cryptocurrencies.

## Backdoors

A backdoor is a way to get into the system, usually bypassing the normal authentication required to do so. The point of creating a backdoor is that criminals can get access faster to the same computer.

## Rootkit

A rootkit modifies the operating system to create a backdoor. They work by takin g advantage of software vulnerabilities to perform privilege escalation and modify system files to create the backdoor.

# Defending against malware

Common ways to defend a system against malware include:
- Antivirus: Although modern antivirus software can catch most form of malware, cybercriminals develop and deploy new threats constantly, which is why it's important to keep the antivirus software up to date constantly.
- Updating software: Updating software is a way to avoid threats from malware by patching the vulnerabilities that these softwares might have had, preventing the exploration of such vulnerabilities by some malware.
